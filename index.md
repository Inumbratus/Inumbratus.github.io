# Who am I?

I'm a Programmer, or "Software Engineer" if we're being fancy. I started programming in 2019, and so as of writing this have 5 years of experience in the field. 
I completed a Diploma and Bachelor's degree of Game Development at SAE Sydney, which took 2 years, and then worked for Spectre Studios, 
then VHS Studios (Spectre was acquired), then at Fenix Studios, which was formed from many of the people who made up Spectre. 

## Experience

I've used Unity & C#, but my preference is certainly UE4/5's Blueprint system and C++.

*	Unreal Engine (4/5)
*	C++
*   Unity
*   C#

# Projects

## University Projects
I worked on a few projects at SAE, but as they were some of my first work and only small in scale, they've been grouped into a single page.

[Uni Projects](./uniprojects.html).

## Emergisim

Emergisim is UE4 powered VR medical training software with First Responder and Military applications. 
I came onto the project a fair ways into development, and worked on creating new medical treatments 
to perform in the project, level management systems (For keeping track of player progress), and frameworks for new scenarios.
```Due to this being an established project, I had to work in a way that did not alter the core logic.```

## FireCPR

### Focus 3 &  Wrist Trackers

## Stryker

###Oculus Quest 2


## Human Park

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one

1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
